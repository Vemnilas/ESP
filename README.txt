# ESP
ESP or "Efficient Savings Program" is my first program about saving, money, costs and earnings.
Keep in mind this is not a finished project. This is just a test version of my final project, so don't think of this as all i can do.
Also, I am a very new programmer, so I may use bad/pointless codes. I am also very young, so that just double does my badness.
I am developing more to this, there will be at least 2 more versions of this. 1 That has more functions, and another that's finished.
Even when it's finished, I may make more versions of this. Please leave comments if you spot mistakes or things I could do better or things i don't need or things I should add into the program. Also Also, I've never used github before, so I may look like an idiot.
